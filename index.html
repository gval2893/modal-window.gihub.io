          Appreciate every moment and every little thing. When you are young,
          you always want everything at once. But why not appreciate every
          little moment? We are not on this planet forever, and the greatest
          pleasure we can afford is to enjoy every moment. Instead of typing
          messages, pick up the phone and talk to a person in person. Visit your
          mother, for no reason at all, just like that. Absorb every moment.

          When you meet someone for the first time, realize that you KNOW
          NOTHING about that person. You see their nationality, their gender,
          their age, their clothes. Forget all that. You know nothing. The
          stereotypes that are shoved into your head because our brain likes to
          categorize everything are limiting your life.

          Don't take everything too seriously. Even if life seems hopeless and
          bleak at times, try to laugh at all this crap and how you got yourself
          into this mess.
